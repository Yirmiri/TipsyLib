Hello!, if you would like to create translations for the mod you are welcome to do so :), I am currentlyonly fluent in English so I can't do anything outside of that. 
Any lang files that aren't en_us are not supported by me and I cannot gurantee they are 100% accurate.
If you decide to help out with translating the mod you can either send the lang file via our Discord server or GitHub page. 

Translator Credits:
- en_us translated by "@yirmiris"
